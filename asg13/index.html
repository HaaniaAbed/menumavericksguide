	<h1>Careers Web Page</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Currently, I have professional experience in mostly graphic design and art; however, over the years, I’ve had practice with working in User Interface Design, coding (in languages such as JAVA, HTML, and CSS), Design Research, and general Graphic Design. I’m also currently trying to complete the requirements in order to get the UI/UX certification, so in the future, the certification will be an additional skill which can give me more experience in this field. As a result, I don’t have a highly specific idea in mind of what exactly I wish to do in terms of which field I forever wish to work in. Although, a job which can take my skills of Graphic Design, coding, or User Interface Design to the use would be an ideal.

   <h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
     <p>For my semester project, I really got inspired from the Single Plate website example mentioned in class, except I really wish there was a version of that where one can modify the results to their needs. <br />For, since there is a whole world full of different cultures, religions, allergies, specific dietary needs, and eating disorders which can all play a part on the acceptance of specific ingredients in recipes, I wish to bring the idea of my semester project in the direction of being able to cater for primarily those who cannot eat certain foods or ingredients for mainly all of these reasons mentioned above. I would also like to have a either a page on the side or perhaps some customizable options so every individual user can interact by selecting the name of the certain diet they are doing, eating disorder/ food sensitivities (such as ARFIDS), the type of allergies or intolerances they may have, or even the type of religion they follow which has a few restrictions on the food the user can eat. With this, I’m thinking of helping the user be able to more efficiently find recipes that they can either take and swap out ingredients so it’ll work for them or even just plainly providing a database of names of dishes that they can safely eat without having to worry about whether or not something as crucial as food won’t be a comfortable experience for them.
