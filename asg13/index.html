	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>Currently, I have professional experience in mostly graphic design and art; however, over the years, I’ve had practice with working in User Interface Design, coding (in languages such as JAVA, HTML, and CSS), Design Research, and general Graphic Design. I’m also currently trying to complete the requirements in order to get the UI/UX certification, so in the future, the certification will be an additional skill which can give me more experience in this field. As a result, I don’t have a highly specific idea in mind of what exactly I wish to do in terms of which field I forever wish to work in. Although, a job which can take my skills of Graphic Design, coding, or User Interface Design to the use would be an ideal.

	  <ol><li>Previously, I didn’t really know much about the three main phases of the Web’s evolution, so it was genuinely extremely interesting to learn more about each one of the phases, Web 1.0, Web 2.0, and Web 3.0</li><br />
          <ul><li>For the Web 1.0 phase, I learned that this one was the initial stage that the Web passed through, which consisted of only a read-only style which shows information with very little to none interactability for the viewers.</li><br />
               <li>For the Web 2.0 phase, I mainly learned that this stage was the phase where the web evolved more into its growing phase, where it allowed some participatory features for users. However, it was mainly the introduction of the evolution of websites and all of the features which they offer now.</li><br />
               <li>For the Web 3.0 phase, I learned about how data got to the point where it got shared across the interface here, leading to the makings of a collective dataset, which all machine learning and artificial intelligence is drawing upon to gain understanding.</li></ul><br /><br />

               <li>At first when I was reading and looking upon the graphics provided about decentralization in terms of data, I got a bit confused with all the information at first; however, it was honestly quite interesting to learn about how after the shift to a collective & connected web of data in Web 3.0, there may be possibility of the actual individual users being able to own their own data in the future, which would be more like a backwards walk from the connected data structure which Web 3.0 introduced after the two initial phases of the Web’s development over the years.</li><br /><br />

               <li>The article, “Wax and Wane of the Web” provided a lot of interesting new information to me about all of the various types of tools that I’ve heard before in the past, but never really looked more deeper into what specifically they do in terms of their purpose, along with the timeline as to when they were developed & widely released for usage across the web. </li><br />
         <ul><li>As an example, I learned about the origin of platforms & tools such as Blogger, Grey Matter, Movable Type, and Wordpress which were actually all early content management systems, which came up during the initial phases of the Web</li><br />
               <li>There were also the later new tools which came up in the later phase that I got to know more about (which in the article, it sounds like it was introduced closer to the time of Web 3.0) such as React, Vue, and Angular which were advanced enough to allow wide ranges of users to fully be able to create their own fully functioning web software.</li>
         </ul></ol>

   <h2>Semester Project Idea</h2>
     <p>For my semester project, I really got inspired from the Single Plate website example mentioned in class, except I really wish there was a version of that where one can modify the results to their needs. <br />For, since there is a whole world full of different cultures, religions, allergies, specific dietary needs, and eating disorders which can all play a part on the acceptance of specific ingredients in recipes, I wish to bring the idea of my semester project in the direction of being able to cater for primarily those who cannot eat certain foods or ingredients for mainly all of these reasons mentioned above. I would also like to have a either a page on the side or perhaps some customizable options so every individual user can interact by selecting the name of the certain diet they are doing, eating disorder/ food sensitivities (such as ARFIDS), the type of allergies or intolerances they may have, or even the type of religion they follow which has a few restrictions on the food the user can eat. With this, I’m thinking of helping the user be able to more efficiently find recipes that they can either take and swap out ingredients so it’ll work for them or even just plainly providing a database of names of dishes that they can safely eat without having to worry about whether or not something as crucial as food won’t be a comfortable experience for them.
