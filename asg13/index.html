	<h1>Careers Web Page</h1>
	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>Currently, I have professional experience in mostly graphic design and art; however, over the years, I’ve had practice with working in User Interface Design, coding (in languages such as JAVA, HTML, and CSS), Design Research, and general Graphic Design. I’m also currently trying to complete the requirements in order to get the UI/UX certification, so in the future, the certification will be an additional skill which can give me more experience in this field. As a result, I don’t have a highly specific idea in mind of what exactly I wish to do in terms of which field I forever wish to work in. Although, a job which can take my skills of Graphic Design, coding, or User Interface Design to the use would be an ideal.
